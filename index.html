We study the Cross-Entropy Method (CEM) for the non-convex
optimization of a continuous and parameterized
objective function and introduce a differentiable
variant (DCEM) that enables us to differentiate the
output of CEM with respect to the objective
function&apos;s parameters. In the machine learning
setting this brings CEM inside of the end-to-end
learning pipeline where this has otherwise been
impossible. We show applications in a synthetic
energy-based structured prediction task and in
non-convex continuous control. In the control
setting we show on the simulated cheetah and walker
tasks that we can embed their optimal action
sequences with DCEM and then use policy optimization
to fine-tune components of the controller as a step
towards combining model-based and model-free RL.

    <strong>Objective Mismatch in Model-based Reinforcement Learning</strong><br>

<div id="abs_lambert2020objective" style="text-align: justify; display: none" markdown="1">
Model-based reinforcement learning (MBRL) has been shown to be a powerful framework for data-efficiently learning control of continuous tasks. Recent work in MBRL has mostly focused on using more advanced function approximators and planning schemes, with little development of the general framework. In this paper, we identify a fundamental issue of the standard MBRL framework-what we call the objective mismatch issue. Objective mismatch arises when one objective is optimized in the hope that a second, often uncorrelated, metric will also be optimized. In the context of MBRL, we characterize the objective mismatch between training the forward dynamics model wrt the likelihood of the one-step ahead prediction, and the overall goal of improving performance on a downstream control task. For example, this issue can emerge with the realization that dynamics models effective for a specific task do not necessarily need to be globally accurate, and vice versa globally accurate models might not be sufficiently accurate locally to obtain good control performance on a specific task. In our experiments, we study this objective mismatch issue and demonstrate that the likelihood of one-step ahead predictions is not always correlated with control performance. This observation highlights a critical limitation in the MBRL framework which will require further research to be fully understood and addressed. We propose an initial method to mitigate the mismatch issue by re-weighting dynamics model training. Building on it, we conclude with a discussion about other potential directions of research for addressing this issue.

Recent work has shown how to embed differentiable optimization problems (that is, problems whose solutions can be backpropagated through) as layers within deep learning architectures. This method provides a useful inductive bias for certain problems, but existing software for differentiable optimization layers is rigid and difficult to apply to new settings. In this paper, we propose an approach to differentiating through disciplined convex programs, a subclass of convex optimization problems used by domain-specific languages (DSLs) for convex optimization. We introduce disciplined parametrized programming, a subset of disciplined convex programming, and we show that every disciplined parametrized program can be represented as the composition of an affine map from parameters to problem data, a solver, and an affine map from the solver&#x2019;s solution to a solution of the original problem (a new form we refer to as affine-solver-affine form). We then demonstrate how to efficiently differentiate through each of these components, allowing for end-to-end analytical differentiation through the entire convex program. We implement our methodology in version 1.1 of CVXPY, a popular Python-embedded DSL for convex optimization, and additionally implement differentiable layers for disciplined convex programs in PyTorch and TensorFlow 2.0. Our implementation significantly lowers the barrier to using convex optimization problems in differentiable programs. We present applications in linear machine learning models and in stochastic control, and we show that our layer is competitive (in execution time) compared to specialized differentiable solvers from past work.

Many (but not all) approaches self-qualifying as &quot;meta-learning&quot; in
deep learning and reinforcement learning fit a
common pattern of approximating the solution to a
nested optimization problem. In this paper, we give
a formalization of this shared pattern, which we
call GIMLI, prove its general requirements, and
derive a general-purpose algorithm for implementing
similar approaches. Based on this analysis and
algorithm, we describe a library of our design, higher, which we share with the community to assist
and enable future research into these kinds of
meta-learning approaches. We end the paper by
showcasing the practical applications of this
framework and library through illustrative
experiments and ablation studies which they
facilitate.

We propose the Limited Multi-Label (LML) projection layer as a new
primitive operation for end-to-end learning systems. The LML layer
provides a probabilistic way of modeling multi-label predictions
limited to having exactly k labels. We derive efficient forward and
backward passes for this layer and show how the layer can be used to
optimize the top-k recall for multi-label tasks with incomplete label
information. We evaluate LML layers on top-k CIFAR-100 classification
and scene graph generation. We show that LML layers add a negligible
amount of computational overhead, strictly improve the model&apos;s
representational capacity, and improve accuracy. We also revisit the
truncated top-k entropy method as a competitive baseline for top-k
classification.

<div id="abs_amos2018end" style="text-align: justify; display: none" markdown="1">
We present foundations for using Model Predictive Control (MPC) as a differentiable policy class for reinforcement learning in continuous state and action spaces. This provides one way of leveraging and combining the advantages of model-free and model-based approaches. Specifically, we differentiate through MPC by using the KKT conditions of the convex approximation at a fixed point of the controller. Using this strategy, we are able to learn the cost and dynamics of a controller via end-to-end learning. Our experiments focus on imitation learning in the pendulum and cartpole domains, where we learn the cost and dynamics terms of an MPC policy class. We show that our MPC policies are significantly more data-efficient than a generic neural network and that our method is superior to traditional system identification in a setting where the expert is unrealizable.

<div id="abs_brown2018depth" style="text-align: justify; display: none" markdown="1">
A fundamental challenge in imperfect-information games is that states do not have well-defined values. As a result, depth-limited search algorithms used in single-agent settings and perfect-information games do not apply. This paper introduces a principled way to conduct depth-limited solving in imperfect-information games by allowing the opponent to choose among a number of strategies for the remainder of the game at the depth limit. Each one of these strategies results in a different set of values for leaf nodes. This forces an agent to be robust to the different strategies an opponent may employ. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach by building a master-level heads-up no-limit Texas hold&apos;em poker AI that defeats two prior top agents using only a 4-core CPU and 16 GB of memory. Developing such a powerful agent would have previously required a supercomputer.

We consider the setting of an agent with a fixed body interacting with an
unknown and uncertain external world. We show that models
trained to predict proprioceptive information about the
agent&apos;s body come to represent objects in the external world.
In spite of being trained with only internally available
signals, these dynamic body models come to represent external
objects through the necessity of predicting their effects on
the agent&apos;s own body. That is, the model learns holistic
persistent representations of objects in the world, even
though the only training signals are body signals. Our

As machine learning techniques have become more ubiquitous, it has
become common to see machine learning prediction algorithms operating
within some larger process. However, the criteria by which we train
machine learning algorithms often differ from the ultimate criteria on
which we evaluate them. This paper proposes an end-to-end approach for
learning probabilistic machine learning models within the context of
stochastic programming, in a manner that directly captures the
ultimate task-based objective for which they will be used. We then
present two experimental evaluations of the proposed approach, one as
applied to a generic inventory stock problem and the second to a
real-world electrical grid scheduling task. In both cases, we show
that the proposed approach can outperform both a traditional modeling
approach and a purely black-box policy optimization approach.

This paper presents OptNet, a network architecture that integrates
optimization problems (here, specifically in the form of quadratic programs)
as individual layers in larger end-to-end trainable deep networks.
These layers encode constraints and complex dependencies
between the hidden states that traditional convolutional and
fully-connected layers often cannot capture.
In this paper, we explore the foundations for such an architecture:
we show how techniques from sensitivity analysis, bilevel
optimization, and implicit differentiation can be used to
exactly differentiate through these layers and with respect
to layer parameters;
we develop a highly efficient solver for these layers that exploits fast
GPU-based batch solves within a primal-dual interior point method, and which
provides backpropagation gradients with virtually no additional cost on top of
the solve;
and we highlight the application of these approaches in several problems.
In one notable example, we show that the method is
capable of learning to play mini-Sudoku (4x4) given just input and output games, with no a priori information about the rules of the game;
this highlights the ability of our architecture to learn hard
constraints better than other neural architectures.

This paper presents the input convex neural network
architecture. These are scalar-valued (potentially deep) neural
networks with constraints on the network parameters such that the
output of the network is a convex function of (some of) the inputs.
The networks allow for efficient inference via optimization over some
inputs to the network given others, and can be applied to settings
including structured prediction, data imputation, reinforcement
learning, and others. In this paper we lay the basic groundwork for
these models, proposing methods for inference, optimization and
learning, and analyze their representational power. We show that many
existing neural network architectures can be made input-convex with
a minor modification, and develop specialized optimization
algorithms tailored to this setting. Finally, we highlight the
performance of the methods on multi-label prediction, image
completion, and reinforcement learning problems, where we show
improvement over the existing state of the art in many cases.

Sum-Product Networks (SPNs) are probabilistic inference machines that admit
exact inference in linear time in the size of the network. Existing
parameter learning approaches for SPNs are largely based on the maximum
likelihood principle and hence are subject to overfitting compared to
more Bayesian approaches. Exact Bayesian posterior inference for SPNs is
computationally intractable. Both standard variational inference and
posterior sampling for SPNs are computationally infeasible even for
networks of moderate size due to the large number of local latent
variables per instance. In this work, we propose a novel deterministic
collapsed variational inference algorithm for SPNs that is
computationally efficient, easy to implement and at the same time allows
us to incorporate prior information into the optimization formulation.
Extensive experiments show a significant improvement in accuracy compared
with a maximum likelihood based approach.

Model-based reinforcement learning (MBRL) has been shown to be a powerful framework for data-efficiently learning control of continuous tasks. Recent work in MBRL has mostly focused on using more advanced function approximators and planning schemes, with little development of the general framework. In this paper, we identify a fundamental issue of the standard MBRL framework-what we call the objective mismatch issue. Objective mismatch arises when one objective is optimized in the hope that a second, often uncorrelated, metric will also be optimized. In the context of MBRL, we characterize the objective mismatch between training the forward dynamics model wrt the likelihood of the one-step ahead prediction, and the overall goal of improving performance on a downstream control task. For example, this issue can emerge with the realization that dynamics models effective for a specific task do not necessarily need to be globally accurate, and vice versa globally accurate models might not be sufficiently accurate locally to obtain good control performance on a specific task. In our experiments, we study this objective mismatch issue and demonstrate that the likelihood of one-step ahead predictions is not always correlated with control performance. This observation highlights a critical limitation in the MBRL framework which will require further research to be fully understood and addressed. We propose an initial method to mitigate the mismatch issue by re-weighting dynamics model training. Building on it, we conclude with a discussion about other potential directions of research for addressing this issue.

We study the Cross-Entropy Method (CEM) for the non-convex
optimization of a continuous and parameterized
objective function and introduce a differentiable
variant (DCEM) that enables us to differentiate the
output of CEM with respect to the objective
function&apos;s parameters. In the machine learning
setting this brings CEM inside of the end-to-end
learning pipeline where this has otherwise been
impossible. We show applications in a synthetic
energy-based structured prediction task and in
non-convex continuous control. In the control
setting we show on the simulated cheetah and walker
tasks that we can embed their optimal action
sequences with DCEM and then use policy optimization
to fine-tune components of the controller as a step
towards combining model-based and model-free RL.

Recent work has shown how to embed differentiable optimization problems (that is, problems whose solutions can be backpropagated through) as layers within deep learning architectures. This method provides a useful inductive bias for certain problems, but existing software for differentiable optimization layers is rigid and difficult to apply to new settings. In this paper, we propose an approach to differentiating through disciplined convex programs, a subclass of convex optimization problems used by domain-specific languages (DSLs) for convex optimization. We introduce disciplined parametrized programming, a subset of disciplined convex programming, and we show that every disciplined parametrized program can be represented as the composition of an affine map from parameters to problem data, a solver, and an affine map from the solver&#x2019;s solution to a solution of the original problem (a new form we refer to as affine-solver-affine form). We then demonstrate how to efficiently differentiate through each of these components, allowing for end-to-end analytical differentiation through the entire convex program. We implement our methodology in version 1.1 of CVXPY, a popular Python-embedded DSL for convex optimization, and additionally implement differentiable layers for disciplined convex programs in PyTorch and TensorFlow 2.0. Our implementation significantly lowers the barrier to using convex optimization problems in differentiable programs. We present applications in linear machine learning models and in stochastic control, and we show that our layer is competitive (in execution time) compared to specialized differentiable solvers from past work.

Training an agent to solve control tasks directly from
high-dimensional images with model-free
reinforcement learning (RL) has proven
difficult. The agent needs to learn a latent
representation together with a control policy to
perform the task. Fitting a high-capacity encoder
using a scarce reward signal is not only sample
inefficient, but also prone to suboptimal
convergence. Two ways to improve sample efficiency
are to extract relevant features for the task and
use off-policy algorithms. We dissect various
approaches of learning good latent features, and
conclude that the image reconstruction loss is the
essential ingredient that enables efficient and
stable representation learning in image-based
RL. Following these findings, we devise an
off-policy actor-critic algorithm with an auxiliary
decoder that trains end-to-end and matches
state-of-the-art performance across both model-free

control tasks. We release our code to encourage

A fundamental challenge in imperfect-information games is that states do not have well-defined values. As a result, depth-limited search algorithms used in single-agent settings and perfect-information games do not apply. This paper introduces a principled way to conduct depth-limited solving in imperfect-information games by allowing the opponent to choose among a number of strategies for the remainder of the game at the depth limit. Each one of these strategies results in a different set of values for leaf nodes. This forces an agent to be robust to the different strategies an opponent may employ. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach by building a master-level heads-up no-limit Texas hold&apos;em poker AI that defeats two prior top agents using only a 4-core CPU and 16 GB of memory. Developing such a powerful agent would have previously required a supercomputer.

<div id="abs_wang2018enabling_all_bib" style="text-align: justify; display: none" markdown="1">
We show how to build the components of a privacy-aware, live video
analytics ecosystem from the bottom up, starting
with OpenFace, our new open-source face recognition
system that approaches state-of-the-art
accuracy. Integrating OpenFace with interframe
tracking, we build RTFace, a mechanism for
denaturing video streams that selectively blurs
faces according to specified policies at full frame
rates. This enables privacy management for live
video analytics while providing a secure approach
for handling retrospective policy
exceptions. Finally, we present a scalable, privacy-aware architecture for large camera networks
using RTFace and show how it can be an enabler for a
vibrant ecosystem and marketplace of privacy-aware
video streams and analytics services.
